C Program that loads in a dictionary &amp; a text file such as a movie script &amp; checks for mis-spellings. Utilises hash tables, linked lists with separate chaining, file I/O &amp; dynamic allocated memory

I kept questions.txt but itâ€™s not relevant (questionnaire for when I submitted this assignment)
